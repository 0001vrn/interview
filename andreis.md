## My training track

**Company**: Google

**Position**: Software Engineer, University Graduate

**Time**: Roughly one month

**Description**: My CV is okay and I have decent algorithms skills, so I will try to focus on cramming as much practice as possible before the actual interview. The languages I will use are:
* C++ for all the interview questions
* Python for my university final year project (and homeworks)
* Go for my personal projects ([new](https://github.com/andreis/new) and [osx-init](https://github.com/andreis/osx-init))

I'm not going to link every single thing since all the links are in the readme. Also, I will update the post with the outcome of the interviews and some details about how it was (without breaking the customary NDA that I signed, obviously).

### Intro (study the process)

* Carefully read all the emails and materials sent by the recruiters
* Read the [articles](https://github.com/andreis/interview#articles) and watch the [videos](https://github.com/andreis/interview#videos)
* Re-read The Google Resume

### Algorithms

* Speed read of the CLRS – while I am aware of the concepts in there, the point is to (i) solidify the theory and have it fresh in my memory (ii) catch some subtleties that I might've missed previously and, imporantly, (iii) solve any interesting exercises and [document it](https://github.com/andreis/coding/tree/master/cormen)
* Read Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual – solve as many problems as possible, either by implementing them or with pen and paper
* Top it off with Programming Pearls, which I always wanted to read

### Coding practice

* Do all practice problems from Hacker Rank (most of them are easy -> good "raw" programming practice)
* Do as many of the Google Code Jam practice problems as possible

### Interview questions

These are best solved either (i) on a whiteboard, (ii) with pen and paper, or ideally (iii) while being mock interviewed by a friend.

* Cracking the Coding Interview
* Programming Interview Exposed
* Coderust
* grokit
* maxnoy

### Behavioural questions training

Prepare a matrix with each project in my resume and the usual biggest challenge/hardest bug/etc bullshit.

#### Extra

If time allows, reading some [Google research papers](http://research.google.com/pubs/papers.html) would be a good idea.

## Other thoughts/ideas

* no more gaming/browsing, relax instead by reading books (a focused brain is a happy brain)
